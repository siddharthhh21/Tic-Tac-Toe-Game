# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This project is a simple, interactive web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing game board where two players can take turns playing as 'X' and 'O'. The game features real-time updates, player turn switching, and automatic detection of the game outcome, whether it's a win, loss, or tie.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: The game board is styled with CSS Grid and Flexbox, ensuring it is centered on the screen, adapting to different screen sizes.
Interactive Gameplay:
Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their mark ('X' or 'O').
The current player alternates automatically after each valid move.
Winner Detection: The game checks for a winner after each move by evaluating possible winning conditions (rows, columns, and diagonals). If a player achieves one of these conditions, they are declared the winner via an alert.
Tie Detection: If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the game declares a tie.
Game Reset: After each game (win or tie), the game automatically resets, allowing players to start a new round.
Lightweight and Fast: The game runs entirely in the browser with minimal code, providing a smooth user experience without any backend server requirements.
Technical Stack:

HTML5: For structuring the game interface.
CSS3: For designing the game layout, including the grid display and styling for the game board and cells.
JavaScript: To handle the game logic, including player interactions, winner checking, turn management, and game resets.
Potential Enhancements:

Add an option to play against a computer AI.
Implement different difficulty levels for the AI opponent.
Add a scoreboard to track multiple game results.
Enhance the UI with more advanced CSS styling and animations for a more engaging user experience.
This project is perfect for those looking to explore front-end web development, focusing on event handling, DOM manipulation, and user interaction through JavaScript.
